Therefore, we analyzed the outcome in the subgroup of hypertensive patients with ECG LV hyper-trophy (n  342) who had a history of AF or electrocardio-graphically veriÔ¨Åed AF at the start of the LIFE study to evaluate the treatment effect of a speciÔ¨Åc angiotensin-II recep-tor versus beta-blockade on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients with ECG LV hypertrophy"

135,"In light of recently published and updated NCEP ATP IIItreatment recommendations,2 an additional analysis withrespect to the proportion of patients who attained an optionaltarget for LDL-C (b70 mg/dL) was further explored in thesubgroup of patients with CHD or CHD risk equivalents per NCEP ATP III definition. Data are also presented for CHD orCHD risk equivalent patients who achieved the currentlyrecommended LDL-C target of b100 mg/dL. An additional posthoc analysis measured high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels from archived baseline and postbaseline (after6 weeks of treatment) plasma samples from 1832 patients.                    A post hoc analysis of attainment of an optional LDL-Ctarget of b70 mg/dL in patients with CHD or CHD riskequivalent confirmed that the more aggressive optionaltreatment target of b70 mg/dL in this subgroup wasdifficult to attain. At the recommended starting dose of10/20 mg of ezetimibe/simvastatin and at the alternativestarting dose of 10/40 mg, 39% and 57% of these patientsachieved an LDL-C goal of b70 mg/dL, compared with6%, 18%, and 23% of patients treated with the recommendedinitial (10 and 20 mg) and alternative (40 mg)starting doses of atorvastatin, respectively.

Regardless ofage subgroup, treatment with EZE/SIMVA was associatedwith a similar incremental reduction in LDL-Ccompared with the pooled SIMVA doses (52% and37%, respectively, in the younger subgroup and 55%and 41%, respectively, in the older subgroup).

196,"Subgroup Analyses Analyses were undertaken in an attempt to identify subgroups with an improved treatment effect. Prespecified analyses used the baseline variables age, sex, duration of type 1 diabetes, method of insulin administration, BMI, HbA1c level, hypoglycemia unawareness status, severe hypoglycemia within the last 12 months, renal function, and geographic region. Post hoc analyses (specified after unblinding) included baseline variables such as smoker status, country, and C-peptide level (less than or greater than or equal to the lower limit of quantification [LLOQ; 0.03 nmol/L]).                                           Subgroup Analyses Subgroup analyses identified no notably different findings, with the exception of C-peptide positivity (Supplementary Tables 5‚Äì10 and Supplementary Fig. 3). In the current trial, 239 of 1,373 subjects with baseline C-peptide measurements were C-peptide positive (value above or equal to the LLOQ [0.03 nmol/L]) (Supplementary Table 1). Baseline characteristics of the C-peptide‚Äìpositive subjects showed a shorter duration of type 1 diabetes and higher baseline HbA1c values (Supplementary Table 1). For both the 1.8 and 1.2 mg liraglutide dose groups, reductions in HbA1c level from baseline were greater for C-peptide‚Äìpositive subjects (0.83% and 0.71%, respectively) than for subjects who were C-peptide negative (0.47% and 0.44%, respectively). For the lowest liraglutide dose group (0.6 mg), HbA1c reductions were similar for C-peptide‚Äìpositive and C-peptide‚Äì negative patients (0.42% and 0.44%, respectively). C-peptide‚Äìpositive subjects also experienced a lower rate of symptomatic hypoglycemia and very few episodes (two, one, zero, and one events, respectively, in the liraglutide 1.8, 1.2, and 0.6 mg, and placebo groups) of hyperglycemia with ketosis (plasma ketone level .1.5 mmol/L) compared with C-peptide‚Äìnegative participants. The interaction between treatment effect and C-peptide positivity was not statistically significant for either HbA1c level or symptomatic hypoglycemia for any dose group (Supplementary Tables 6 and 8, respectively). For all liraglutide dose groups, estimated mean reductions in HbA1c level were greater for patients with a baseline HbA1c level ,8.5% of those with a baseline HbA1c level of$8.5% (1.8 mg 0.57% vs. 0.46%; 1.2 mg 0.54% vs. 0.40%; 0.6 mg 0.44% vs. 0.41%).
